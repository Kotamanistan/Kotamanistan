Hello. I am Yusuf
I'm studying digital game design at Beykoz University.
I am game developer.
I am working on Unity.
Apart from game design, I also want to deal with various software works.
One of them is cyber security.
I am particularly interested in software security.
I will have several studies on this.
I always want to improve myself and I am ready to do anything about it.
